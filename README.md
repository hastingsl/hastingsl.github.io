# My personal professional website

I made this site from scratch using Jekyll, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, minimal jQuery and Bootstrap. Its also mobile friendly!

The main personal page is complete. I intend to add a blog in the near future.

Feel free to file an issue or send me a message if you notice any spelling errors or have issues viewing it on different devices.
