# My personal professional website

I made this site from scratch using Jekyll, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, minimal jQuery and Bootstrap. Its also mobile friendly!

The main personal page is complete, but I intend to add a portfolio and blog section in the near future. I also use this site to learn and test different web design and development technologies; most recently, I started using a Standard JS Atom linter and changed my existing CSS to use SASS.

Feel free to file an issue or send me a message if you notice any spelling errors or have issues viewing it on different devices.
