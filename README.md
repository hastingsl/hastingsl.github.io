# My personal website

This is my professional website for marketing myself as a software engineering student. On it, you'll find various relevant social media links.

I made this site from scratch using Jekyll, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, minimal jQuery, and the Bootstrap library.

Feel free to file an issue or send me a message if you notice any spelling errors or have issues viewing it on different devices.
