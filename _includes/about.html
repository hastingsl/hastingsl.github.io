  Hi! My name is Lauren Hastings. I'm a sophomore at the University of Central Florida in Orlando studying computer science and math (the official, fancier name of my degree is Computational Applied Mathematics). This semester I'll be starting undergraduate research into computational humor, something new and interesting!
</p>
<p>
  I'll be interning with Apple in Cupertino, California this summer as a software developer intern, and I couldn't be more excited! I started my move out west last summer by interning with Intel in Chandler, Arizona. I worked in design automation with Perl, a fun departure from my previous experience in web development.

  As an aspiring software engineer I don't like to repeat myself, so all you'll find on this site is what you can't find on my <a alt="Resume" href="files/resume-lauren-hastings.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> (a succinct list of important information) and my <a alt="Linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hastingsl" target="_blank">Linkedin</a> (everything worth knowing about me, professionally, at least). Scroll down to see a list of featured projects from my <a alt="Github" href="https://www.github.com/hastingsl" target="_blank">Github</a> or check out my <a alt="Blog" href="blog" target="_blank">blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to email me or add me on Linkedin if you'd like to connect or know of any student opportunities. I'm particularly interested in doing pro-bono technical projects and consulting for non-profits, so if you know anyone who needs help or your organization would like assistance, don't hesitate to contact me!
